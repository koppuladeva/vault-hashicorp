Starting the vault Server on dev mode
vault server -dev

With the dev server started, perform the following:

Launch a new terminal session.

Copy and run the export VAULT_ADDR ... command from the terminal output. This will configure the Vault client to talk to the dev server.

$ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'

Vault CLI determines which Vault servers to send requests using the VAULT_ADDR environment variable.

Save the unseal key somewhere. Don't worry about how to save this securely. For now, just save it anywhere.

Set the VAULT_TOKEN environment variable value to the generated Root Token value displayed in the terminal output.

example export VAULT_TOKEN="s.XmpNPoi9sRhYtdKHaQhkHP6x"

Verify the Server is Running
